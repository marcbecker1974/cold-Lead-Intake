# Cold Lead Intake

Cold Lead Intake is a small browser-based B2B sales research app
for capturing and maintaining potential property management target
companies before qualification.

## Stack

- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- No backend
- No user accounts
- Browser-based persistence for a single user

## Run the app

Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

## Rules

- Use the Next.js App Router and the `app/` folder for all pages.
- Do not add new libraries, backend services, external APIs, or major
  features without asking first.
- For UI and visual design decisions, follow the principles in
  `docs/github-primer-design.md`.
- For data persistence, follow the decision in
  `docs/persistence-decision.md` (browser `localStorage`).
- For the cited Next.js page and routing conventions used in this project,
  refer to `docs/nextjs-creating-a-page.md`.

## Git workflow

- Work directly on `main` unless I explicitly ask for a separate branch or
  pull request.
- Do not create branches automatically. If you believe a branch is
  necessary, ask me before creating one.
